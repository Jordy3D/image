## about
image is a collection of simple browser-based tools for working with images. each tool is designed to perform a specific task quickly and efficiently, with a clean and consistent interface.

currently available tools:
- **chroma** - recolour images by replacing specific colours with new ones
- **tile** - check how well an image tiles/repeats for seamless patterns
- **resize** - resize images with different algorithms and download the result
- **convert** - convert images to different formats

## usage
1. visit the tool page you need
2. upload an image using the file input or paste from clipboard
3. adjust the settings as needed 
4. view the results in real-time

each tool has specific features:

### chroma

- adjust colour sensitivity to control the range of colours affected
- use multiplier mode to automatically generate secondary colours
- add or remove colour pairs as needed (shift+click to remove)

### tile
- adjust tile size to view how it looks at different scales

### resize
